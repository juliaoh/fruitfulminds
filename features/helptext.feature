Feature: Provide textual guidance

  As an admin
  So that I can easily fill out the curriculum generation correctly
  I want to see sample texts in fields of survey template creation

Background: logged in as admin

  Given dataset1 is set up
  And I am logged in as "approved_user@gmail.com" with "12323" as my password

Scenario: 
  When I'm on the new survey template page
